# Welcome to 0x01. C — Variables, if, else, while
## Description
#### This section focuses on learning more about C variables, if and else statements, while loop, relational and logical operators.At the end of this section, students are expected to have understood:

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered `TRUE` and `FALSE` in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the `if, if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- How to use variables with the while loop
- How to print variables using printf
- What is the `ASCII` character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64.

## Tasks
### [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)
— This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed in a nice formatted output.

### [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
— This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5HWhPDsq3jq1yCRQFrLl4Q) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

### [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabet.c)
— This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line with a required use of the `putchar()` function.

### [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)
— This program prints the alphabet in lowercase except `q` and `e`, followed by a new line with a compulsory use of the `putchar()` function.

### [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)
— This program prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, followed by a new line with a compulsory use of the `putchar()` function.

### [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)
— This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

### [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
— This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 with a strict exception of the `char` data type usage,and also the `printf` and `puts` functions,finally followed by a new line.

### [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)
— This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

### [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)
— This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/NureniJamiu/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)
— This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers in ascending order, separated by a comma `,`, followed by a space. The usage of any variable of type `char` is strictly not allowed likewise the use of `printf` and `puts` functions.
